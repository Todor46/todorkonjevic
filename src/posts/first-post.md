## Testing our first post

I'm not going to write to much here because I don't want to write anything more than this.
If you are still reading this, then you must be very bored. Go and do something else please.  
STOP READING!!!

Omg... okay, I guess you are going to read all of this. I might as well write something worth reading then.
Here it goes...

Once upon a time I wrote my first blog post. I was wondering if anyone is ever going to read this, but then I remembered. I'm not writing this for you to read, I'm writing it for myself!
So how can I utilize this magnificient habit of writing a blog to improve my daily life? Maybe it will help me declutter my mind by writing down my thoughts?
No, no, no... That is a purpose of a diary.  
Maybe it can help me better understand some new tech that I'm looking into.

Hmm... that actually sounds like a **GREAT IDEA**!

Trying to document the process of building something is like a diary. The practice helps clarify the process and solidifies the theory by trying to remember the process and writing it down.

But this is also a new habit that I'm trying to get into my system, so I may not be consistent with it, but I'll try. We'll see.

Thanks for reading my first blog post. You are awesome! 😎
